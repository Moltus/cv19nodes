# Connected nodes system

Goal is to make a fully WYSIWYG text and image node input system with every node being able to get connected to any number of other nodes.
Fully ES6 classes oriented, **every node is an object** ; children and parent nodes being properties of each one.
User would be able to save his layouts on .json files.

Currently no node input (WIP). Just buttons to show the **dynamic** nature of the system.
