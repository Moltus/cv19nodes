# Connected nodes system

Goal is to make a fully WYSIWYG text and image node input system with every node being able to get connected to any number of other nodes.
Fully ES6 classes oriented, **every node is an object** ; children and parent nodes being properties of each one.
User would be able to save his layouts on .json files.

There is currently no way to input texts or images (WIP), just buttons to demo the mechanics behind.
